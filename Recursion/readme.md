# Recursion from basic to Advance 


## Important thing about Recursion
All the lines and operator written before the recursive call are Executed First i.e. executed when going from lower to higher Stack
While All the lines and operator written after the recursive call are Executed when the base condition reached i.e. executed when coming back from higher to lower Stack
